        <h1>Thanks!</h1>
        <p>Thanks for helping to test out Fork Yeah! The idea behind this site is to help gain exposure for <strong>undiscovered</strong> open source projects. Projects from prominent developers or organizations already get plenty of attention by virtue of their pedigree. However, there are a <i>ton</i> of great open source projects by little known developers that deserve just as much attention. This site features those, and only those, and in doing so attempts to gain some traction for the most deserving ones.</p>
        <p><strong>TL/DR:</strong> Fork Yeah! is like Product Hunt for open source projects that have limited exposure.
        <p>Here's the deal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Projects must have less than 200 GitHub stars when added.</li>
            <li>Projects must have at least 3 months commit history.</li>
            <li>Projects must have at least 10 commits.</li>
            <li>Projects must have a readme file.</li>
            <li>Listings are actively ranked for 96 hours.</li>
            <li>Rankings are based on increase in GitHub stars.</li>
            <li>Statistics data (stars, commits, etc.) is refreshed every 10 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>So what am I asking you to test?</strong> Not much - I plan to try my hardest to get this site off the ground (after all, this kind of thing only works with lots of participation) but I'd like a few eyes other than mine before I do. If you don't mind taking a few minutes just to check it out and provide comments below (or to me at dave@somedave.com), it would be greatly appreciated. Also, please don't hold back - any comments or criticisms are welcome. Here's some ideas on what to look at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you add a new project?</li>
            <li>Is clicking on the project name to get details obvious enough?</li>
            <li>Does logging in to GitHub work?</li>
            <li>Can you star a project?</li>
            <li>Does the site work in your browser of choice?</li>
            <li>Can you comment?</li>
            <li>Does it work on your mobile device?</li>
            <li>Generally, what do you think of the site, concept, etc.?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks again for your time! <strong><a href="http://forkyeah.azurewebsites.net">http://forkyeah.azurewebsites.net</a></strong> (site will move to forkyeah.net once I release it).</p>
